        <p><strong><em>UX/UI Full Stack Developer</em></strong></p>
        <p>I’m Mexican and I would like to participate in the selection process for
          Project Manager. I'm Computational Engineer, from Tecnológico de Monterrey
          in México. Throughout more than 9 years of work experience, I had been
          specialized in IT processes, counting with ITIL certifications
          (Fundamentals, SOA, OSA, PPO, ST, and CSI), Cobit, and Windows MTA. Also,
          I have taken some courses in Scrum Master (the certification is on hold),
          ITIL V4, Project Management and Full Stack Developer. I have worked in
          banking, consulting, and food companies. I also have covered roles as
          process manager, project manager, and Service Owner. During my professional
          life, I had the opportunity to develop international scope projects in
          areas of banking security, financial systems, retail systems, and inventory
          control. In the same way, during this period I had been responsible for
          designing and optimizing processes, that allow a correct alignment to the
          business needs.</p>
